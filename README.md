# FourRooms2D
##### Unity Editor Version: 2018.1.7f1

This is a 2D version of the FourRooms Unity project, created for running human neuroscience experiments in an MRI scanner.
The gameplay is taken from the 3D repo FourRooms, with minor changes accounting for player control, the 3D nature of pickups and other gameobject interactions.
